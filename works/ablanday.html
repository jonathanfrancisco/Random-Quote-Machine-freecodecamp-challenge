			<h3>Who is Roque Ablan?</h3>
			<strong> Early life and education</strong>

					Ablan was born in Laoag, Ilocos Norte to Victor Ablan and Raymunda Blanco who were both poor. To be able to attend the public elementary school and high school of Laoag, he worked as a helper in a lumberyard. He finally obtained his high school diploma in 1924.

			Ablan taught in a Chinese elementary school and at the Yangco campus of the Association Institute to be able to send himself to the University of the Philippines in Manila. He also workedfor the Philippine Herald as editor of the Carnival Courier, a periodical published during the carnival season. In 1929, he received his bachelor's degree in philosophy and his law degree a year later.

			<strong>Career</strong>

				As a lawyer, Ablan focused on helping poor people and laborers with their cases. He became president of the Ilocos Norte chapter of the U.P. Alumni Association, and the secretary of the Ilocos Norte Bar Association.

In 1937, Ablan ran under the Nacionalista Party and won as governor of Ilocos Norte. His candidacy was well supported by politicians Ulpiano Arzadon, [[Severo Hernando, Irineo Ranjo and Roman Campos. He also received an endorsement from the province's Federation of Women's Clubs. At 31, he was the youngest in the history of the province to be elected governor.

As governor, Ablan was active in solving the lawlessness and unemployment problems in the province. He increased the daily wages of the laborers, revived the credit associations, and encouraged people to organize cooperatives. He was able to beautify the province and establish a branch of the Philippine Normal School in Laoag.

Ablan won another term as governor in the next election. During his second term, he was chosen secretary of the Governor's League and was chosen by Manuel Quezon for a post in the President's cabinet. This plan never pushed through, however, as the Japanese forces had invaded the country after the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

			<strong>Japanese occupation</strong>

			On 10 December 1941, Japanese forces landed in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. The following day, Ablan decided to resist the invasion. He met with other provincial leaders and sought refuge in the town of Solsona, his father's birthplace. With the help of other government officials and prominent citizens, he was able to organize a guerrilla unit.

In 15 January 1942, Abdon met with Feliciano Madamba, a member of the United States Army in the Far East (USAFFE). The two founded the Ablan-Madamba Guerilla group of Northern Luzon. The group had their first encounter in 28 January 1942.

On 17 February 1942, Ablan's unit attacked the Japanese army stationed in Banna. The following month, he hiked through the mountains of Cabugao, Apayao to communicate with the Commonwealth authorities.

On March 15, President Quezon issued a statement of support for Ablan's guerrilla group. WHe encouraged independent guerrilla groups to accept Ablan's leadership and rally behind him. Ablan established a guerrilla government and divided the province into sectors, with each sector led by a guerrilla leader. The headquarters of this guerrilla government was known as the Malakanyang of the North.

On 4 July 1942, the northern unit resisted another attack from the Japanese. The Japanese became aggressive and hunted Ablan and his men. The guerrilla government was raided on 18 July 1942.Ablan was forced to evacuate his family somewhere else. The Japanese sought the help of Filipinos such as Emilio Medina, Camilo Osias, Quintin Paredes, Jose P. Laurel, and Benigno Q. Aquino, Sr. to urge Ablan to surrender and cooperate with the colonizers.

However, on 8 November 1942, Ablan and his troops struck the Japanese once more. On 10 December 1942, he left for Cagayan to meet with Marcelino Adduru, the provincial governor. It was the last time the family saw him alive.

On 28 January 1943, the Japanese raided his headquarters in Tamdagan, Vintar and left his army crippled. The following day, his wife and son were captured together with two American soldiers in Apayao, Mountain Province.

On 31 January 1943, Ablan came under attack which separated him from his men. He was never found from then on and was assumed to be killed in action.
